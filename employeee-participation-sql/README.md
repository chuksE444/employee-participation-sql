# 🧑‍💼 Employee Participation Information System – SQL Project

This project showcases my ability to use **SQL (SQL Server)** for real-world data querying, analysis, and basic data manipulation. The goal was to simulate an **employee participation information system**, starting from database setup (DDL and DML) to data retrieval (DQL).

## 📚 Project Overview

I built and queried a database containing tables for:
- Employees
- Departments
- Projects
- Employee participation in projects (with roles)

The project includes:
- Creating and populating tables using **DML** and **DDL**
- Writing advanced **DQL** queries to extract insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

---

## 🧩 Database Structure

This system includes four tables:
- `Department`: department name and manager
- `Employee`: name, role, salary, and department
- `Project`: title, dates, and department
- `Employee_Project`: links employees to projects with assigned roles

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries Performed

- Employees assigned to more than one project
- Projects with department labels and manager names
- Employee roles on the “Website Redesign” project
- Departments with the most employees
- Employees earning over 60,000, by department
- Total salary expenditure per department
- Summary of employee roles across all projects

## 📁 Files Included

- `Eva DML Checkpoint.sql`:  
  Contains the DDL and DML code to create and populate the database schema.

- `DQL Checkpoint.sql`:  
  Contains the SELECT queries used to retrieve and analyze data.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure and manage SQL databases
- Writing practical SELECT queries with JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions
- Gained hands-on practice with real-world database design and analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Visualize this data using **Tableau or Power BI**
- Create a dashboard with insights like project participation or salary distribution
- Build more case studies using public datasets
